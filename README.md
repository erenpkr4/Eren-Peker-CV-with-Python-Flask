# Eren-Peker-CV-with-Python-Flask
My CV project which is created using HTML, CSS, Python and Flask.

The zip version includes a virtual environment where you can use this command:
      "pyinstaller -w -F --add-data "templates;templates" --add-data "static;static" cv.py"
to create an executable file which runs on your localhost.
